h1. gem-patching

gem-patching provides a mechanism for marking a code block as a patch targeting a specific version of a gem and be notified when that gem is updated, so that developers can assess whether the patch continues to be necessary.

<pre>
# cucumber_patch.rb
Gem.patching('cucumber', '0.8.0') do
  # your code patching cucumber '0.8.0'
end
# this will raise the following exception if cucumber is updated:
# Attempt to apply patch targeting version '0.8.0' of 'cucumber', but active version is '0.8.1'
</pre>

h3. Installation

gem install gem-patching
